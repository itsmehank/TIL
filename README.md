## Today I Learned

This Project is commiting what I learned everyday for next 365 days. 

There's no limitation of subjects to learn so it could be just a translation of document related computer science. 

Just only one thing I should keep in mind for doing this project is do whatever which is fun for me. 

Keep your interest on your life and you have to live your day as if you live for a fun.

Done is better than Perfect!
